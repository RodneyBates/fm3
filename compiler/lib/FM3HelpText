FM3 arg ..

Arguments beginning with "--", e.g. "--src-dir" are long-form options.
Those beginning with "-", e.g. "-S"  are short-forms.  Those with neither
are file names to be compiled.  All options have a long form.  Some have
an equivalent short form.   Some options require a parameter following
the option name.  

Some long form options allow "no-" prefix to negate the option, e.g.
"--no-log".  The parameter to a long-form option can either follow
the option name in the same argument, separated by an equal sign "="
or stand alone in the following argument.

A short-form option has a single-character name.  Multiple such
character names can be concatenated in a single argument introduced
by "-".  Only the last of these can have a parameter.  The parameter
to a short-form option name can immediately follow in the same argument
with no delimiter or stand alone in the following argument.

Some options accumulate when they occur multiple times. Those that do
not can also occur multiple times, in which case the last one prevails.

Boolean options default to FALSE. 

-v
--version
       Display version and exit.

-h
--help
       Display help and exit.

-s<filename> 
--src-file[=]<filename>
       Compile <filename>

-I<directory>
--import-dir[=]<directory>
       Look for compiled versions of exported and imported interfaces
       in <directory>. Accumulates. 

-S<directory>
--src-dir[=]<directory>
       Look for source files with unqualified names in <directory>.
       Includes files named by a dashless argument, --src-file, -s, and
       exported and imported interfaces not found compiled in any
       --import-dir. Accumulates.

-B<directory>
--build-dir[=]<directory>
       Put compiled files in <directory>.  Defaults to <1stsrcdir>/../build,
       where <1stsrcdir> is the directory containing the first-named source
       file to be compiled.

--resource-dir[=]<directory>
       Look in <directory> for various resource files needed by the compiler.
       Defaults to <exeDir>/../lib, where <exeDir> is the directory containing
       the executable for the FM3 compiler.  This help text is one such
       resource, so you might need to specify --resource-dir prior to --help.

--[no-]stderr 
       Write compilation process messages to stderr. Defaults to TRUE. 
      
--[no-]log 
       Write compilation process messages to compiler log file FM3Log,
       in the current working directory.  Defaults to TRUE 

--[no-]stdout
       Write compiled code messages to stdout.  Defaults to TRUE 

--[no-]unit-log 
       Write compiled code messages for each compiled source code unit
       to a unit-specific log file named <srcFileName>.log, in the same
       directory as <srcFileName>. 

-K
--[no-]keep
       Keep intermediate compilation files in the build directory.

--[no-]remove-unused-decls
       Don't compile declarations that can have no references.  Declarations in
       the top scope of an interface are always treated as referenceable.
       defaults to FALSE. 
       
-k<passNum>
--[no-]keep-passes[=]<passNum> ..
       Keep intermediate compilation files for pass number[s]
       <passNum> .. in the build directory.
       
-D
--[no-]disasm
       Disassemble intermediate compilation files in the build directory.
       Implies --keep.

--[no-]disasm-verbose
       When disassembling intermediate files, show displacements and
       binary values of token codes. Defaults to TRUE.  
       
-d<passNum>
--[no-]disasm-passes[=]<passNum> ..
       Disassemble intermediate compilation files for pass number(s)
       <passNum> .. in the build directory.
       Implies --keep-passes with same parameter. 
       
-E
--[no-]exprs
       Write expression data structure dump files in the build directory. 
       Implies --keep.

-e<passNum>
--[no-]exprs-passes[=]<passNum> ..
       Write expression data structure dump files for pass number(s)
       <passNum> .. in the build directory.
       Implies --keep-passes with same parameter.
       
--[no-]expr-addrs
       Include hex addresses in expression dumps. (These will be different
       in every run, even for equivalent data structure.) Defaults to FALSE.

--[no-]std-sources
       Include Main.i3 in the compile even when exported onlyh implicitly.
       Defaults to TRUE.
