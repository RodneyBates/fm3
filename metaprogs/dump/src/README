Dump will not compile on account of an incomplete attempt
to use compiler/src/utils/FM3Messages in it.

This would have to pull in a lot of stuff, unit-at-a-time.
Dump's functions are now integrated into the compiler, and
expanded to display different argument kinds.  So dump will
probably be removed in the future.

Replacement code is (mostly) in compiler/src/FM3Disass.[im]3.
