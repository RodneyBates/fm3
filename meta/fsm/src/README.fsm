Program to build, off-line, tables for a finite state machine that
will scan a set of fixed character strings and convert them to integer
codes.

To be compiled, it needs file ../../compiler/src/shared/FM3LexTableRep.i3,
which is also needed by the compiler itself.

FM3LexTable.[im]3 are a runtime for these tables.
